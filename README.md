# James-Dalal-Kousi-et-al-BJMGH-2022
The R Markdown (Rmd) file containing the script for statistical analyses described in the article James, Dalal, Kousi, et al., BMJ Gloabl Health, 2022 (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.21.21262401v2) along with the associated datafile (in csv format).  
The details of the analyses, the variables, etc. are explained in the original article. 
The variable names are intuitive, and it should not be hard for someone who has familiarity with English language to understand the meaning of the symbols. 
If still there is any difficulty in understanding the script (or the symbols), please contact the corresponding author (Email address: ananthu89jms@gmail.com).
